Otherwise/If - making it implicitly detect when chained else if's were occurring.
End - we didn't like enforcing white spaces like in python, but then didn't want 
      curly braces either, so we emulated Ruby and used "End" to signify a closed If Block.
Capitalizing - We wanted the sentences to be read more like English, so we force capitalizing
               of all statements other than section titles that are user defined.
Commenting - We added commenting more easily into the grammar after having done the grammar_orig.txt
Go vs Move - We weer interchangeably using "go" vs "move", and decided to stick with "go"

Do - we almost had functions. But realized that do should just be a "go to" in essence. We don't want
     to build stacks and that functionality would be too far away from our Specific in DSL.

We reverted commenting to be scala style instead of picobot style to save on time in implementation
